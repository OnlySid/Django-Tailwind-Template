# Django + Tailwind CSS Starter Kit
This is a starter template for Django + Tailwind CSS. There are many ways to configure such an environment but I've found this to be the easiest.


## Getting Started
This tutorial will cover setting up a base project with Django, Tailwind and MySQL but any of the steps can be swapped out with technologies of your choosing.

### Prerequisites
Here's what needs to be installed before we are able to continue:
- Python
- NodeJS
- Apache
- mod_wsgi
- MySQL (PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQLite)
- Git
- pip

### Setup
This workflow requires a virtual environment to handle dependencies properly. First, we'll enter a new virtual environment and then install everything we need. Enter the following into the terminal at this file's base directory.

```
pip install pipenv
```
```
pipenv shell
```
This will take you through a setup process.

```
sh setup.sh
```
This completes the Tailwind and Django setup.
